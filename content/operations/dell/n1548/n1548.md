enable
configure
interface vlan x
ip address x.x.x.x/xx
ip default-gateway x.x.x.x
```

Set user

```bash
enable
configure
username user_name password user_password privilege 15
enable password enable_password
```

Enable SSH

```bash
crypto key generate dsa
crypto key generate rsa
ip ssh server
```

Save configuration changes

```bash
wr
```

## Link Aggregation Groups (LAGs)

Static

```bash
enable
configure
interface range 1-4
channel-group 1 mode on
end
show interfaces port-channel 1
```

Dynamic (LACP)

```bash
enable
configure
interface range 1-4
channel-group 1 mode active
end
show interfaces port-channel 1
```

Remove port from channel group

```bash
interface gigabitethernet x/x/1
no channel-group
```

## VLAN

Create VLAN

```bash
vlan vlan_id
```

VLAN name

```bash
name vlan_name
```

Remove port mode

```bash
no switchport mode
```

Go to interface

```bash
interface gigabitethernet x/x/x
```

### Port in Access mode

Set Access mode

```bash
switchport mode access
```

Set the interface as a member of the specified VLAN

```bash
switchport access vlan vlan_id
```

### Port in Trunk mode

Set Trunk mode

```bash
switchport mode access
```

Default trunk mode allows all vlans.

```bash
switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

Add VLAN to the VLAN allowed list

```bash
switchport trunk allowed vlan add vlan_id
```

Remove the listed VLANs from the allowed list

```bash
switchport trunk allowed vlan remove vlan_id
```

Allows all VLANs other than those listed

```bash
switchport trunk allowed vlan except vlan_id
```

Sets the untagged VLAN for the trunk port

```bash
switchport trunk native vlan vlan_id
```

### Port in General mode

Set General mode

```bash
switchport mode access
```

Add VLAN to the VLAN allowed list

```bash
switchport general allowed vlan add vlan_id
```

Remove the listed VLANs from the allowed list

```bash
switchport general allowed vlan remove vlan_id
```

Set the port VLAN ID

```bash
switchport general pvid vlan_id
```

Set the port to pass untagged packets for the specified VLAN

```bash
switchport general allowed vlan add vlan_id untagged
```

The port will only accept tagged frames. Untagged frames are dropped at ingress.

```bash
switchport general acceptable-frame-type tagged-only
```

Turn off ingress filtering so that all received tagged frames are forwarded whether or not the port is a member of the VLAN in the tag.

```bash
switchport general ingress-filtering disable
```
